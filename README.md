## BRIEF DESCRIPTION
What this code does is as follows:
 - Step 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Step 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 - Step 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Step 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 - Step 5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
